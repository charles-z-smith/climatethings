climatediff.py >>  This script is to simply display the temperature difference during the period of Jan/Feb of 2011 and Jan/Feb of 2014. However, it can be easily manipulated to compare other periods of time.  Red colored filled contours means 2011 was warmer than 2014, and vice versa for the blue colored filled contours. Data obtained from http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/thredds/catalog/Datasets/ncep/catalog.html

temptimeseries.py >> This script plots the yearly average temperature over a certain point.  I decided to plot temperatures near Milwaukee, but it could work for any point.

The scripts in this repository address mostly climate data, but I will expand it over time as well.
